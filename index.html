<center> <h1>Welcome to the Indian Ocean Slave Trade Project</h1> </center>
<p align="justify">
 This project aims to provide both scholars and the public with accessible and easily navigable information on the Indian Ocean slave trade during the 19th and 20th centuries. Like the Atlantic slave trade, millions of Africans and other peoples were abducted and transported across the Indian Ocean to work as slaves in foreign lands. In contrast to the Atlantic slave trade, however, which boasts an extensive scholarly literature and a greater public awareness, few publicly available resources are devoted to the study of the Indian Ocean slave trade. In order to increase awareness of the legacy of the Indian Ocean slave trade and to facilitate further study, this site presents multiple resources. </p>
<p align="justify">
  As you can see from the heat map below, our data and project currently emphasizes the East African slave trade to the Persian Gulf. However, this is an ongoing project with much more to explore, and thus our data (and maps) will continue to be expanded and revised. In the near future, we intend to expand the project to include slave routes and experiences in the Arabian Peninsula, Yemen, the Red Sea, Egypt, Sudan, and from East Africa to the Atlantic world.</p>
